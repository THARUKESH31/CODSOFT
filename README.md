# CODSOFT
This repository contains the web development projects completed during my internship at CodSoft. It includes responsive and dynamic web pages built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of the internship tasks. The projects demonstrate my learning in frontend development, layout design, and user interaction.
